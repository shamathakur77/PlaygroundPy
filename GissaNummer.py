       "IPython offers a fully compatible replacement for the standard Python\n",

       "\n",
       "  Typing ?word or word? prints detailed information about an object. Certain\n",
       "  long strings (code, etc.) get snipped in the center for brevity.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Typing ??word or word?? gives access to the full information without\n",

       "\n",
       "  The ?/?? system gives access to the full source code for any object (if\n",

       "* Tab completion in the local namespace:\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "* Search previous command history in multiple ways:\n",

       "    through the history items that match what you've typed so far.\n",
       "\n",
       "  - Hit Ctrl-r: opens a search prompt. Begin typing and the system searches\n",

       "  for later re-execution, with the %macro function.\n",
       "\n",
       "  The history function %hist allows you to see any part of your input history\n",
       "  by printing a range of the _i variables. Note that inputs which contain\n",
       "  magic functions (%) appear in the history with a prepended comment. This is\n",
       "  because they aren't really valid Python code, so you can't exec them.\n",
       "\n",
       "* Output caching system:\n",
       "\n",
       "  For output that is returned from actions, a system similar to the input\n",
       "  cache exists but using _ instead of _i. Only actions that produce a result\n",
       "  (NOT assignments, for example) are cached. If you are familiar with\n",

       "  counter), such that the result of output <n> is always available as _<n>.\n",
       "\n",
       "  Finally, a global dictionary named _oh exists with entries for all lines\n",
       "  which generated output.\n",
       "\n",
       "* Directory history:\n",
       "\n",
       "  Your history of visited directories is kept in the global list _dh, and the\n",
